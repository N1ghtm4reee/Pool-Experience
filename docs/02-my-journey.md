My Journey
During this piscine, we began with shell days, where we tackled exercises that required us to use commands to solve problems and produce specific outputs. This experience significantly improved our ability to navigate the computer.

We then progressed to C programming challenges, with each day focused on a main topic. Some of the subjects I explored include:

Pointers\n
String manipulation\n
Recursion
Memory allocation
argc and argv
Pointer functions
File manipulation
These topics were essential to my learning journey during the piscine.
