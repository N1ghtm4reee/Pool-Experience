Introduction

My name is Ayoub Akhrif, and I’m 18 years old from Tangier. Since I was 12, I’ve dreamed of 
experiencing the 1337 school. I first saw it on TV back in 2018, and I’ve been waiting to turn 18 to 
finally join this incredible journey. I joined the piscine to immerse myself in a challenging coding 
environment, develop my skills, and be part of a unique community of passionate learners.
